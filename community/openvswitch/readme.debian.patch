-additional features, you will need to build and install a Linux kernel
-module by hand from the openvswitch source package.

-Open vSwitch integration with systemd-networkd
------------------------------------------------
+Notes on LXC integration:
+-------------------------
 
-There is no native integration of OVS with systemd-networkd. That is,
-you cannot create OVS bridges, ports and bonds by simply writing configuration
-files in /etc/systemd/network.  But, you can create OVS devices using ovs-vsctl
-and then write configuration files to provide them IP addresses.
+To prevent containers failing to start after hard reboots create:
+-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
-As soon as a OVS device is visible, systemd-networkd will provide that device
-an IP address.  Since OVS database is persistent across reboots, the OVS
-devices will get re-created after a reboot as soon as OVS startup script is
-invoked. And systemd-networkd will immediately assign the configuration defined
-in /etc/systemd/network.
+/etc/lxc/ovsup:
 
-Example:
+#!/bin/sh
+ovs-vsctl --if-exists del-port $5
+-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
-If you have a physical ethernet device "ens160" which has been configured with
-DHCP, your systemd-networkd's .network config file will look something like
-this:
+/etc/lxc/ovsdown:
 
-```
-[Match]
-Name=ens160
+#!/bin/sh
+ovs-vsctl --if-exists del-port veth.$LXC_NAME
+-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
-[Network]
-DHCP=ipv4
+& add to the container config file:
 
-[DHCP]
-ClientIdentifier=mac
-```
+lxc.hook.pre-start = /etc/lxc/ovsup
+lxc.hook.post-stop = /etc/lxc/ovsdown
 
-Please note how the DHCP ClientIdentifier above has been configured with the
-mac address.
 
-To create a OVS bridge "br-ens160" and add "ens160" as a port of that
-bridge, you can change the .network configuration for "ens160" to look like:
-
-```
-[Match]
-Name=ens160
-```
-
-Now create a new .network configuration file for "br-ens160". Something like:
-
-```
-[Match]
-Name=br-ens160
-
-[Network]
-DHCP=ipv4
-
-[DHCP]
-ClientIdentifier=mac
-```
-
-Now, use ovs-vsctl to create br-ens160 and add ens160 as a port of it.  You
-will also have to flush the IP address of ens160 and restart systemd-networkd
-in the same line. It is important to let br-ens160 have the same mac address as
-ens160 to get the same IP address to br-ens160 from the DHCP server.  In the
-below command, "$mac_of_ens160" holds the mac address of ens160. For e.g:
-
-```
-mac_of_ens160='"00:0c:29:77:27:7a"'
-ovs-vsctl --may-exist add-br br-ens160 -- \
-    --may-exist add-port br-ens160 ens160 -- \
-    set interface br-ens160 mac="$mac_of_ens160"; ip addr flush dev ens160; \
-    systemctl restart systemd-networkd
-```
-
-br-ens160 should now have the same DHCP IP. It should also have the correct
-DNS resolution servers configured.
-
-Notes on dependencies:
----------------------
-
-openvswitch-switch depends on $network, $named $remote_fs and $syslog to start.
-This creates some startup dependency issues.
-
-* Since openvswitch utilities are placed in /usr and /usr can be mounted
-through NFS, openvswitch has to start after it.  But if a user uses openvswitch
-for all his networking needs and hence to mount NFS, there will be a deadlock.
-So, if /usr is mounted through NFS and openvswitch is used for all networking,
-the administrator should figure out a way to mount NFS before starting OVS.
-One way to do this is in initramfs.
-
-* Since openvswitch starts after $network, $remote_fs and $syslog, any startup
-script that depends on openvswitch but starts before it, needs to be changed
-to depend on openvswitch-switch too.
-
-* Ideally, an admin should not add openvswitch bridges in the 'auto'
-section of the 'interfaces' file (i.e., if "br0" is a OVS bridge, you should
-not have a line "auto br0"). This is because, when ifupdown starts
-working on bridges listed in 'auto', openvswitch has not yet started.
-
-But, if the admin wants to go down this route and adds openvswitch bridges
-in the 'auto' section, openvswitch-switch will forcefully be started when
-ifupdown kicks in. In a case like this, the admin needs to make sure that /usr
-has already been mounted and that a remote $syslog (if used) is ready to
-receive openvswitch logs.
-
-* With systemd, adding openvswitch bridges in the 'auto' section of the
-'interfaces' file can cause race conditions (i.e., if "br0" is a OVS bridge,
-you should not have a line "auto br0").  Debian systems have added a
-systemd ifup@.service file.  This file will call ifdown and ifup on interfaces
-in "auto" section automatically when the interfaces disappear and appear
-respectively.  This will cause race conditions if you delete and add the same
-bridges using tools like "ovs-vsctl" or "ovs-dpctl".  This is also a problem
-when you upgrade your openvswitch kernel module using commands like
-'force-reload-kmod'.
