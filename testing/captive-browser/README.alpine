Using captive-portal on Alpine Linux
====================================

captive-portal requires some configuration to:

1. Set a browser to be started with a SOCKS5 proxy.
2. Determine the nameserver advertised via DHCP.

When using BusyBox udhcpc, it is recommended to have it write a custom
resolv.conf file containing the DHCP-advertised name server. A config
for this setup is available in `captive-browser-alpine-chromium.toml`.
This file must be copied to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/captive-browser.toml`.
